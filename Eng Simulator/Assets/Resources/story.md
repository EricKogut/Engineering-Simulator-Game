# Eng Simulator â€” Story and Dialogue

## Info

Each bullet is one "box" worth of dialogue. All boss events are triggered after the player acquires a certain amount of experience points.


The story begins when the player enters SEB (tutorial level). The player is faced with a fearsome threat: two TAs, he must defeat them.

Another NPC in close proximity to the player discloses some basic controls:

* Hello, young freshman, you should take care of those TAs over there.
* You may fire your main attack with "l", try it! You can also fire your ultimate with "q".
* You can sprint with shift, but watch your energy levels, you do have 7 courses to deal with after all!

After these two TAs are dealt with the player is prompted to talk with another NPC:

* As you defeat enemies and complete objectives, you will gain experience.
* You can use the experience points to level up your skills and gain new abilities.
* After you gain enough experience to move on to second year, you may pick a discipline! Each comes with its own specialized skillset.

This concludes the tutorial level.


The following is dialogue spoken by the boss-Joan Rikkerson-enemy prior to the first boss fight (marking the culmination of first year):

* So you've made it this far... I shouldn't have underestimated you.
* However, you're not ready for what I have in store... You won't pass...
* THE FINAL DESIGN SHOWCASE

Another NPC (normal TA) is present after the fight:

* You've done it, you passed all your first year courses!
* You may now choose a discipline. Choose wisely, each has its benefits and drawbacks.
* Except Software of course, it's all benefits. 175,000 benefits to start... if you go to Cali.


The following dialogue is spoken by the second boss-Dwayne Jacks-prior to the second boss fight (marking the culmination of fourth year):

* I know you weren't expecting to see me after second year...
* But after three years, I finally have your Analog Logic Systems mark...
* Let's see if you passed!
